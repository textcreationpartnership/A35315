            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Of the first Chapter (the <hi>Exercise of Armes and Military Motions, &amp;c.</hi>) many bookes are obvious; and therefore I have thought fittest to begin at the second, which is of <hi>Castrametation</hi> or <hi>Encamping;</hi> wherein I have desired to be the more large, because our Nation is not beholden to any (to my knowledge) that hath laboured therein; and the deputy Lieutenants of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, finde a want of men fit to be Quarter-masters. I have desired your Patronage, both in respect of my many obligations; as also for that I know you able to correct what is amisse, and courteous to pardon it.

               <p>Of Camps there bee three kinds. 1. <hi>Castra Temporanea.</hi> 2. <hi>Castra Sustentoria.</hi> 3. <hi>Castra Strataria.</hi>

                  <hi>Castra Temporanea,</hi> is a temporarie Campe, which is but for a nights continuance, or so; and is alwayes in motion.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51324:4"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Castra Sustentoria,</hi> is a flying Armie, to stay an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies invasion, and to hinder him from advancing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Country; to that end alwayes attending his motions, dislodging when he dislodgeth, and encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping when he encampeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Castra Strataria,</hi> is a Campe to environ and besiege a Towne or Fortresse.</p>
               <p>When the Army marcheth, so long as the Enemy bee farre of, and that the Country be at your devotion, it may be lodged in Villages, (staying but a night, or so) yet must you not omit the usuall Guards and Sentinels: But if you march through the Enemies Country, or that he be neere hand, the best way is to lodge in the field; for that you shal be the more ready to make resistance, if you should be charged on the suddaine. All possible care must be taken to arrive before night (the Generall having sent a good party of Cavallerie before to discover about and beyond the place) and the Quarters may be secured by waggons, Freese-Ruyters, Pallisadoes, &amp;c. Or else (especially if the Army make any stay) the Infantrie are to encompasse the Quarters with a Retrenchment of six foote high and three foote thicke, for their better securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the moorish grounds may bee enclosed by Freese-Ruyters or Pallisadoes; which may be cast upon wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons gons when the Armie dislodgeth. Some peeces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance may also be planted towards the Anvenues, wher the Enemies might assaile the Quarters. But if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe be for some siege, when the Army is come neere to the place which is intended to bee besieged, there you make your <hi>Castra Strataria,</hi> and quarter after the third manner.</p>

                  <hi>Hyginus Gromaticus,</hi> and others; the summe whereof are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Quarters bee not commanded by some higher ground neere hand, whereby they might lye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Enemies view, comming to relieve the Towne or Fortresse besieged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they be seated neere some River (if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) for the benefit of men and cattell, for the cheaper conveyance of necessaries, for the encompassing and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Campe (whereby much labour and cost of Fortification is saved) and for the avoyding of the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse of carrion, and filth, and the Butchers slaughter houses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there be no woods nor groves neere, where the Enemie might lie hid, and thence continuallie vexe you; but that the ground be a plaine Champaine, that so you may discover the Enemie a farre of, and retard him by your Cannon, and have time to put your Forces into battalia.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there be no moorish ground nor boggs neere hand, lest your Armie grow diseased by the stenches and infectious vapours thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the ground bee not subject to bee overflowed with water, either in Autume or Winter; or that it bee not made so by Art (either by the besieged, or such as may come to relieve them) by bringing the water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you from some other place, by cutting their bankes, or by meanes of their sluces.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there be good convenience of Forrage, Wood, and straw neere hand.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51324:5"/> 7. That the Quarters bee not too neere the Towne, lest you be galled by their Cannon; nor too farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, lest your men which worke in the Approaches, be thereby hindred from being timelyrelieved from the Quarters.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the Quarters bee of fitting breadth and length according to your forces; lest that (being made too little) the souldiers bee hindred from making good defence, by reason of the straitnesse of roome; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too large, they want men to man so vast a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Lastly and principally, that all the passages be well guarded, that the Enemie may not cut off your victuall. But because it seldome falleth out that a Campe hath all these conveniencies, you must labour to helpe that by Art, which nature affordeth not.</p>
               <p>If there be any high ground neere, you may possesse it your selfe (if the condition of the place will permit it) or if there be some other convenient place neere hand, you may environ the highest ground with a Trench, and make Redoubts about it: but if the high ground bee on some passage, or place of importance, you may build a Fort upon it, and so take away the Enemies advantage.</p>
               <p>When there is no River, you must be content to bring all necessaries to the Quarter by Waggons and Carts, taking good order that they be hired at reasonable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and for the avoyding of stench, the Carrion must be carried out of the Quarters, and there buried in pits thereunto appointed; and the Butchers must there kill their beasts, and bury all their filth.</p>
               <p>The Woods, if they extend not far from the Campe, may be encompassed with Trenches (if it be not too chargeable) which then are usefull to afford wood for Huttes and other uses; but if they be too far off, or of too great a circuit, they may be cut downe, or fired.</p>
               <p>If there be water which may be kept up by the besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to overflow the Campe, you must seeke to prevent it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51324:5"/>by certaine bankes, or by diverting it another way, as necessity and experience will direct.</p>
               <p>These things being well advised on, and having good information of the condition and scituation of the place which you intend to besiege, being come within 6. or 8. miles of the place, the Quartermaster Generall rides before with 80. 100. or 120. Horse to take a view of the Ground, and presently causeth a designe to bee made thereof, that so hee may the readilier and better divide the Quarters.</p>
               <p>The Quarters are not alwaies alike, but according to the scituation of the place, and sometimes the Campe is divided into 2.3.4. or more Quarters. Their forme is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ground, and the quantitie of Regiments to be lodged in them.</p>

               <p>Supposing the said Company to consist of 100 men, or there-about, there is a <hi>Parallelogram</hi> of ground allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, containing 300 foote in depth and 24 foote in breadth: whereof 180 foote in depth is allowed for the souldiers Hutts, then 20 foote is appointed (behind them) for a streete; next that 40 foote in depth is for the Captatines lodging; then 40 foote for another streete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Captaines lodging and the Suttlers, and last of all 20 foote in depth for the Suttlers, whereof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most 10 foote are for their hutts, and the other 10 foote for their kitchins: which together makes 300 foot.</p>
               <p>Now the said 24 foote of breadth for the said Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as farre as 180 foote in depth is divided into 3 equall parts, namely 8 foote for one file (or Row) of Hutts, then 8 foote for a streete, and lastly 8 foote for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond file of Hutts.</p>
               <p>Each file of Hutts is divided according as the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers desire to accommodate themselves; for one alone, there is 4 or 5 foote allowed in depth (or more if the number be smaller then 100 men) if two lodge together, they are allowed 6 or 7 foote; that so the more ground may be allowed to such souldiers as have their wife and Children there.</p>
               <p>At the head of these 2 files of Hutts, that on the right hand is the Lieftenants Hutt, and that on the left, is the Ensignes, both fronting towards the Allarme place.</p>
               <p>All the rest of the Hutts have their doores opening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the said street of 8 foote wide, over against each other, saving the 2 last Hutts, which are for the Sergeants, whose doores open into the street of 20 foote broad.</p>
               <p>Betweene every Hutt there should be 1 or 2 foote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance left, for the draine of the water, and also that (if any fire should happen) it may be the sooner quenched.</p>
               <p>No souldier is suffered to have any fire in his Hutt (it being onely built of poles and straw) but such as will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51324:6"/>dresse their owne meate, are to doe it in the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, behinde their Suttlers Huttes.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers build their owne Huttes, the Country people thereabout furnishing them with materials.</p>
               <p>The Captaines have the whole breadth of 24. foote for their lodgings, their Enclosure having an opening towards the streete of 20. foote, and another towards that of 40. foote, having a trench of 5. foote high, and a moate of 4. foote depth and breadth round about them, and set about with boughs. The custome (now adaies) is that they lodge in Huttes (as being more warmer and more durable) and use Tents for their kitchins and stables.</p>
               <p>The Suttlers doores open into the said streete of 40. foote broad.</p>
               <p>If the Company consist of 130. 140. or 150. men, they have ground allowed them for 3. files of Huttes; if of 180. or 200. for 4. files.</p>
               <p>To make all the more plaine, observe in figure 1. <hi>a.b.c.d.</hi> whereby the quartering of one Company is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>A Regiment consisteth of Companies, some being of 8. other some of 10. 12. 14. 16. 18. Companies. There is also a difference in the number of each Company, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Quarters must be proportioned accordingly.</p>
               <p>Howsoever, the depth is alwaies 300. foote, without alteration, in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his warres; so saith our Author. For the French manner of Encamping, though <hi>de</hi>

                  <hi>Ville</hi> would have a Regiment of foote to take up 600. foote in depth, whereof 400. foote for the Souldiers Huttes onely. The Collonels lodgings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the middle; so his Regiment is divided into 2. equall parts on each hand of him (unlesse there be an odde number of Companies) and a streete of 8. foote broad betweene each Companie, into which no doores open.</p>
               <p>He hath 68. foote of breadth (or more if the ground
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51324:7"/>will permit) allowed him for his lodgings; (entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as the Captaines enclosures) and on each side a streete of 8. foote broad.</p>
               <p>About 16. foote before the Lievtenants and Ensignes Huttes are croches set, with a pole a crosse at the top, there to place the Pikes of the Company, and by them a frame to lay their Muskets on, and there are the Colours also planted. But some hold it better (both for readines, incase of an Alarum, as also for keeping the Muskets cleane) that the Souldiers keepe them in their Huttes.</p>
               <p>The figure 1. representeth a Regiment of 10. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, of 100. men a peece, whereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Is the Collonels lodging, of 68. foote breadth: some would have him to have 76. others 78. foote, but that is left to discretion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Here some would lodge the Chaplaine, Quarter-Master, Surgeon, and the like: and leave onely <hi>C.</hi> for the Collonels waggons &amp;c.

               <p>The late manner of lodging the Captaines in the Reare of their Companies, (which change was since our Author writ his booke) is for two reasons. 1. That they may the better prevent, and also punish the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders usually committed in the Suttlers Huttes. 2. That the Souldiers may have the freer and readier passage into the allarum place.</p>

               <p>THe Horse are usually quartered by themselves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of inconveniencies when they bee quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the foot.</p>

               <p> Every Troope of Horse is allowed 300. foot of ground in depth, and breadth according to their number.</p>
               <p>A Troope of 100. Horse hath 70. foot of breadth, and 180. foot in depth for 2. files of Huttes and Stables. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souldier having 10. foot in breadth for his Hut. Next their Huttes there is a small streete of 5. foot broad, into which their doores open. Then there is 10. foot in breadth allowed (on each side) for the Stables, so that there is a street left of 20. foot broad betweene the two files of Stables, 50. Horses being placed on the one side, and 50. on the other. Every Souldier, and every stable, having 4. foot of ground in depth.</p>
               <p>But if there be 130. or 140. Horse in a Troope, there is another file of Huts and stables allowed them, as before, and a street of 20. foot broad as the other, to divide them from the next troope.</p>
               <p>Every Souldier hath his Horse standing just over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne Hut, with his head that way, that he may the better see him eate his oates.</p>
               <p>The formost Hut on the right hand is for the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that on the left, for the Cornet; the two last for the Quartermaster and Corporall.</p>
               <p>There is a row of mangers along the foreparts of the stables, over against the Riders dores, and for every horse there is a partition, made of a pole, to divide them from each other.</p>
               <p>If the Army make any long stay, the horses are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red overhead (to keepe them from wet and cold) either with Canvas or straw, after the manner of a shade, but open before and behinde.</p>
               <p>To make all the more plaine, see in figure 2. <hi>a. b. c. d.</hi> shew the manner of Quartering of one troope of 100. horse, (or thereabout) whereof the measures are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the figure.</p>
               <p>A Regiment of horse confisteth (usually) of 3. or 4. troops, and are quartered as the said figure sheweth. The Collonell hath no more ground then the other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51324:8"/>And untill of late, the Collonels of horse in the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> his Armie had no more pay then the other Captaines; but now there is a larger stipend gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them, and the Sergeant Major.</p>

                  <hi>E.</hi> Are the Sutlers huts; namely, 1. for the huts, and 2. for their fires and Cookery. Some would have three crosse streets (of 8. foot broad) to runne a crosse through the Quarter, at <hi>F.

               <p>Concerning the Sutlers huts, the leaving of so much space betweene them as is in figure 1. is conceived to bee needlesse; but onely here and there a passage; so to give them the more roome for their huts.</p>

               <p>In this ground the waggons are placed in files (or Rowes) taile to taile, leaving a streets of 12 foote betweene them, wherein the waggoners may lay their for age. But betweene every couple of files there runnes a streete of 24 foote broad, for passage through the Quarter.</p>
               <p>To each waggon with 3 horses there is 12 foote al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in depth and 18 foote in breadth, namely 6 foote for the breadth of the waggon, and 12 foote for 3 horses.</p>
               <p>The waggoners usually lodge in their waggons, or under them; but such as will build hutts, may doe it in the said streete of 12 foote broade, behind their waggon.</p>
               <p>And howsoever there be many waggons imployed in the Armie more then are here quartered, it must be bonsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that many Officers doe keepe their waggons neere them, in their owne Quarters.</p>
               <p>On the 4 sides of the Quarter are the Suttlers Hutts which follow the waggons, which have 12 foote òf ground apeece, both in depth and breadth.</p>
               <p>All which is more plainely shewed in figure 6. which containeth 10 files of waggons, of 14 waggons in each file, which makes together 140 waggons.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the said streetes are ot so broad as 24 foot (if there be want of ground) that so the more waggons may be placed in the Quarter.</p>
               <p>Some, instead of making the 4 sides of the Quarter to serve for Hutts, doe there place waggons, and leave an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen space (instead thereof) of 60 foote broad, in the

               <p>F. is a streete of 20 foote broade, betweene each couple of files of Huttes. Some make a streete (of 20 or 24 foote broad) at <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>I.</hi> into the markett place.</p>

               <p>Some make 2 foote spare betweene each Hutt, for the draine of water.</p>
               <p>There be two Quarters more, namely for the Strangers, (noble men or the like) and for the Magazine of Victual, whereof it shall be needlesse to make defignes; because the Strangers have onely a peece of ground laide out, of 300 foote deepe, and breadth according to their use; which then they cause to be divided, and place their Tentes and Hutts according to their pleasure.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eing that divers Quarters are to be made for the said Armie (as 11 for the 11 Regiments of Infanterie, &amp; as many for so many Regiments of Cavallrie, besides the other Quarters) It were a worke of infinite trouble to make a designe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient placing of them, and that in hast, (for that upon viewing of the ground, it is presently to be done) but that there is this helpe to be used.</p>
               <p>Every one of the said Quarters must be drawne (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand) upon severall peeces of fine past-board (such as our playing Cardes are made of) which must be so cut as that they all may have 300 foote in depth, and so many foote in breadth as every list will require. As for Example, General <hi>Ʋere</hi> his Regiment having 300 foote in depth and 580 foote in breadth, (as was shewed in Chapter 12) you must cut a peece of past-board of just such a scantling (according to some small scale) and then write upon it the Collonells name, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the breadth, as here is shewed. (Some would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so have the number of Companies and of the Files of Huts requisite for them to be mentioned on every past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, as you see it in Chapter 21. Figure 13. which I conceive to be commendable.) And so for all the rest.</p>

               <p> All these past-boards you must so often move and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, untill they lye in such order as ye desire to have them. And for the more ready doing of it, you must draw certaine parallell lines upon a sheete of paper, of 50 foote distance, for the streets, with spaces of 300 foot,

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51324:23"/>(as is shewed in figure 8.) thereby the better to lay the said past-boards in order.</p>
               <p>In making the said Quarters, his <hi>Excellence</hi> having caused the ground to be viewed, resolved not to quarter the Horse, the waggons, the <hi>English</hi> under Generall <hi>Cecill,</hi> nor the <hi>Scots,</hi> within the Campe: so the past-boards of

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51324:24"/>their Quarters being laid aside, the rest were ordered as in the 9. Figure.</p>
               <p>Yet if in the placing of these Quarters, you find that the Quarter would be more regular, if some of them were somewhat enlarged or lessened; in such cases you may somewhat alter the Quarters of the Waggons, Market, Artillery, Victuall, Strangers, and the ground for the Generalls Quarter. But the Regiments of foote and Horse, the Quarters for the Generall of the Artillery, and the Generals lodgings, must not be altered.</p>
               <p>According to the past-boardes so placed, the designe is to be drawne upon paper, with allarme places on all sides, as is shewed in Figure 10.</p>

               <p>Then you are to marke out the circuit of the whole Quarter, by foure exteriour lines; so that each corner of the Quarter make a right Angel; setting a quartering staffe in each of them.</p>
               <p>Then you are to measure out the particular Quarters; and so soone as the ground of one Regiment be laid out, the particular Quarter-master of that Regiment takes notice of it (for all the particular Quarter-masters, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Quarter-master Generall in this work;) So (all the quarters being measured out) the said staves will stand, as is shewed in figure 11.</p>

               <p>Then the Sergeants of every Company presently fall to subdivide the ground for the Souldiers Huts. To doe this, they must precisely know how many Huts they are to have, and what Souldiers desire to lodge together. If two files of Huts will serve his Company, he straines foure lines from the markes made by his Quarter-master, as in the said figure is she wed by <hi>A, D. E, F. G, H.</hi> and <hi>I, K.</hi> And to set forth the ground for every Hut, he prickes downe foure stickes, to give direction where the foure corner posts of every Hut shall stand. So then the Souldiers build their owne Huts accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Sergeants must take care that no Souldier build otherwise, than precisely as his ground is allowed him, and to this the Quartermasters, Captaines, and Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels must have an Eye.</p>

Then (with the helpe of 50. or 60.

               <p>The length of ground which every Regiment is to digge, is to be marked on the outside of the outward-most lockspitting, with a crosse cut in the ground. As for example, in Chap. 18. Figure 10. If you begin at the Angle <hi>H.</hi> there making a crosse, you measure from thence 1454. foot for <hi>Chastillon</hi> his Regiment, which will extend to <hi>I.</hi> where you must also make a crosse. In like manner measuring 1454. foot for <hi>Bethune</hi> his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51324:27"/>they will extend as farre as to the crosse <hi>I</hi> and so for the rest.</p>
               <p>But seeing that the said Figure 10. sheweth but the Quartering of the foot onely, and but a part of them neither, (for reason before given) I have here added the figure 13. wherein all the Horse, Foot, Officers, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and Waggons are Quartered, according to the severall Lists before mentioned, wherein observe that the Generals Quarter comprehendeth double the usuall ground, for some reason extraordinary.</p>
               <p>The two Quarters for Stakenbrooke and Marquet, I conceive might more conveniently have beene placed nearer to Count <hi>Jobus</hi> Regiment of Horse; for so the street betweene <hi>Hinderson</hi> and <hi>Stakenbrooke,</hi> also that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Marquet</hi> and <hi>Bepane,</hi> would have beene wider (which are now but 30 foot wide) and the other two streetes on each side of Count <hi>John,</hi> which are now 55 foot wide, would have beene more regular.</p>
               <p>Some would have the Moate of the Retrenchment to be seven or eight foote wide, and five or six foot deepe, and about two foot and a halfe broad at the bottome: The Parapet to be eight foot broad at the Basis (besides a foot banke of three foot broad) and six foot high; as appeareth by their <hi>Peofiles;</hi> But no certaine generall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can be set downe for the Retrenchments, because they are subject to alteration and change.</p>
               <p>First, In regard of their forme, which must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected according to the place which is to be fortifyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In regard of their matter; for in some places there is good earth, in others sandy, in others moorish, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In regard of the enemies being neare, or far off; weake, or strong, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In regard of the condition and scituation of the Campe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And accordingly the Retrenchments are to be fortified
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51324:27"/>by <hi>Tenailles, Ravelins, Redouts,</hi> and halfe <hi>Redouts, Forts, Horne-workes, Croune-workes, &amp;c.</hi> (as need and occasion shall require) observing the distance of 60. or 70. rod (being the reach of Musket shot) betweene worke and worke, on a right line.</p>
               <p>But seeing these things doe properly belong to the Art of <hi>Fortification,</hi> and my purpose was onely to speake of <hi>Castrametation,</hi> I will put an end to this Discourse.</p>
